# =================================================================
# General configuration
# =================================================================

# Time in seconds to wait before resending an outgoing QoS=1 or 
# QoS=2 message.
#retry_interval 20

# Time in seconds between updates of the $SYS tree.
#sys_interval 10

# Time in seconds between cleaning the internal message store of 
# unreferenced messages. Lower values will result in lower memory 
# usage but more processor time, higher values will have the 
# opposite effect.
# Setting a value of 0 means the unreferenced messages will be 
# disposed of as quickly as possible.
#store_clean_interval 10

# Write process id to a file. Default is a blank string which means 
# a pid file shouldn't be written.
# This should be set to /var/run/mosquitto.pid if mosquitto is
# being run automatically on boot with an init script and 
# start-stop-daemon or similar.
#pid_file

# When run as root, drop privileges to this user and its primary 
# group.
# Leave blank to stay as root, but this is not recommended.
# If run as a non-root user, this setting has no effect.
# Note that on Windows this has no effect and so mosquitto should 
# be started by the user you wish it to run as.
#user mosquitto

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages currently inflight per 
# client.
# This includes messages that are partway through handshakes and 
# those that are being retried. Defaults to 10. Set to 0 for no 
# maximum. Setting to 1 will guarantee in-order delivery of QoS 1 
# and 2 messages.
#max_inflight_messages 10

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages to hold in a queue 
# above those that are currently in-flight.  Defaults to 100. Set 
# to 0 for no maximum (not recommended).
#max_queued_messages 100

# =================================================================
# Default listener
# =================================================================

# IP address/hostname to bind the default listener to. If not
# given, the default listener will not be bound to a specific 
# address and so will be accessible to all network interfaces.
# bind_address ip-address/host name
#bind_address

# Port to use for the default listener.
port 10011

# The maximum number of client connections to allow. This is 
# a per listener setting.
# Default is -1, which means unlimited connections.
# Note that other process limits mean that unlimited connections 
# are not really possible. Typically the default maximum number of 
# connections possible is around 1024.
#max_connections -1

# =================================================================
# Extra listeners
# =================================================================

# Listen on a port/ip address combination. By using this variable 
# multiple times, mosquitto can listen on more than one port. If 
# this variable is used and neither bind_address nor port given, 
# then the default listener will not be started.
# The port number to listen on must be given. Optionally, an ip 
# address or host name may be supplied as a second argument. In 
# this case, mosquitto will attempt to bind the listener to that 
# address and so restrict access to the associated network and 
# interface. By default, mosquitto will listen on all interfaces.
# listener port-number [ip address/host name]
#listener

# The maximum number of client connections to allow. This is 
# a per listener setting.
# Default is -1, which means unlimited connections.
# Note that other process limits mean that unlimited connections 
# are not really possible. Typically the default maximum number of 
# connections possible is around 1024.
#max_connections -1

# The listener can be restricted to operating within a topic hierarchy using
# the mount_point option. This is achieved be prefixing the mount_point string
# to all topics for any clients connected to this listener. This prefixing only
# happens internally to the broker; the client will not see the prefix.
#mount_point

# =================================================================
# Persistence
# =================================================================

# If persistence is enabled, save the in-memory database to disk 
# every autosave_interval seconds. If set to 0, the persistence 
# database will only be written when mosquitto exits.
# Note that writing of the persistence database can be forced by 
# sending mosquitto a SIGUSR1 signal.
#autosave_interval 1800

# Save persistent message data to disk (true/false).
# This saves information about all messages, including 
# subscriptions, currently in-flight messages and retained 
# messages.
# retained_persistence is a synonym for this option.
persistence true

# The filename to use for the persistent database, not including 
# the path.
#persistence_file mosquitto.db

# Location for persistent database. Must include trailing /
# Default is an empty string (current directory).
# Set to /var/lib/mosquitto/ if running as a proper service.
persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/

# =================================================================
# Logging
# =================================================================

# Places to log to. Use multiple log_dest lines for multiple 
# logging destinations.
# Possible destinations are: stdout stderr syslog topic
# stdout and stderr log to the console on the named output.
# syslog uses the userspace syslog facility which usually ends up 
# in /var/log/messages or similar.
# topic logs to the broker topic '$SYS/broker/log/<severity>', 
# where severity is one of D, E, W, N, I which are debug, error, 
# warning, notice and information.
# Use "log_dest none" if you wish to disable logging.
log_dest stdout

# Types of messages to log. Use multiple log_type lines for logging
# multiple types of messages.
# Possible types are: debug, error, warning, notice, information, 
# none.
# Note that debug type messages are for decoding the incoming 
# network packets.
# They are not logged in syslog.
log_type error
log_type warning
log_type notice
log_type information

# If set to true, client connection and disconnection messages will be included
# in the log.
connection_messages true

# If set to true, add a timestamp value to each log message.
log_timestamp true

# =================================================================
# Security
# =================================================================

# If set, only clients that have a matching prefix on their 
# clientid will be allowed to connect to the broker. By default, 
# all clients may connect.
# For example, setting "secure-" here would mean a client "secure-
# client" could connect but another with clientid "mqtt" couldn't.
#clientid_prefixes

# Boolean value that determines whether clients that connect 
# without providing a username are allowed to connect. If set to 
# false then a password file should be created (see the 
# password_file option) to control authenticated client access. 
# Defaults to true.
allow_anonymous false

# Control access to the broker using a password file. The file is a
# text file # of lines in the format:
# username:password
# The password (and colon) may be omitted if desired, although this 
# offers very little in the way of security.
password_file /home/kamil/Programming/Source/mqtt-spy/mqtt-spy-common/src/test/resources/mosquitto/mosquitto_users.txt

# Control access to topics on the broker using an access control list
# file. If this parameter is defined then only the topics listed will
# have access.
# Topic access is added with lines of the format:
#
# topic [read|write] <topic>
# 
# The access type is controlled using "read" or "write". This parameter
# is optional - if not given then the access is read/write.
# <topic> can contain the + or # wildcards as in subscriptions.
# 
# The first set of topics are applied to anonymous clients, assuming
# allow_anonymous is true. User specific topic ACLs are added after a 
# user line as follows:
#
# user <username>
#
# The username referred to here is the same as in password_file. It is
# not the clientid.
#
#
# If is also possible to define ACLs based on pattern substitution within the
# topic. The patterns available for substition are:
#
# %c to match the client id of the client
# %u to match the username of the client
#
# The substitution pattern must be the only text for that level of hierarchy.
#
# The form is the same as for the topic keyword, but using pattern as the
# keyword.
# Pattern ACLs apply to all users even if the "user" keyword has previously
# been given.
#
# pattern [read|write] <topic>
#
# Example:
#
# pattern write sensor/%u/data
#
#acl_file

# =================================================================
# Bridges
# =================================================================

# Experimental support for connecting multiple MQTT brokers 
# together.
# Specify multiple sets of connection, address and topic 
# configurations.
# Each connection must have a unique name.
# Only a single address per configuration is currently supported, 
# unlike in rsmb.
# The direction that the topic will be shared can be chosen by 
# specifying out, in or both, where the default value is out. 
# The QoS level of the bridged communication can be specified with the final
# topic option. The default QoS level is 2, to change the QoS the topic
# direction must also be given.
# Multiple topics can be specified per connection, but be careful 
# not to create any loops.
#connection <name>
#address <host>[:<port>]
#topic <topic> [[out | in | both] qos-level]

# Set the client id for this bridge connection. If not defined, 
# this defaults to 'name.hostname' where name is the connection 
# name and hostname is the hostname of this computer.
#clientid

# Set the clean session variable for this bridge.
# When set to true, when the bridge disconnects for any reason, all 
# messages and subscriptions will be cleaned up on the remote 
# broker. Note that with cleansession set to true, there may be a 
# significant amount of retained messages sent when the bridge 
# reconnects after losing its connection.
# When set to false, the subscriptions and messages are kept on the 
# remote broker, and delivered when the bridge reconnects.
#cleansession false

# If set to true, publish notification messages to the local and remote brokers
# giving information about the state of the bridge connection. Retained
# messages are published to the topic $SYS/bridge/connection/<clientid>/state.
# If the message is 1 then the connection is active, or 0 if the connection has
# failed.
#notifications true

# Set the keepalive interval for this bridge connection, in 
# seconds.
#keepalive_interval 60

# Set the start type of the bridge. This controls how the bridge starts and
# can be one of three types: automatic, lazy and once. Note that RSMB provides
# a fourth start type "manual" which isn't currently supported by mosquitto.
#
# "automatic" is the default start type and means that the bridge connection
# will be started automatically when the broker starts and also restarted
# after a short delay (30 seconds) if the connection fails.
#
# Bridges using the "lazy" start type will be started automatically when the
# number of queued messages exceeds the number set with the "threshold"
# parameter. It will be stopped automatically after the time set by the
# "idle_timeout" parameter. Use this start type if you wish the connection to
# only be active when it is needed.
#
# A bridge using the "once" start type will be started automatically when the
# broker starts but will not be restarted if the connection fails.
#start_type automatic

# Set the amount of time a bridge using the lazy start type must be idle before
# it will be stopped. Defaults to 60 seconds.
#idle_timeout 60

# Set the number of messages that need to be queued for a bridge with lazy
# start type to be restarted. Defaults to 10 messages.
# Must be less than max_queued_messages.
#threshold 10

# Set the username to use when connecting to an MQTT v3.1 broker 
# that requires authentication.
#username

# Set the password to use when connecting to an MQTT v3.1 broker 
# that requires authentication. This option is only used if 
# username is also set.
#password

# External security checks
# =================================================================

# This section defines options for potential use with external
# databases. 
# They are intended to make it easier to add external security
# checks along with WITH_EXT_SECURITY_CHECKS. If you haven't written
# code to support another database and compiled support in, you are
# unlikely to need to change anything here.
